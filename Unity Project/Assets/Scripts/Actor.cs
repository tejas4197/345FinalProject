/*

An Actor is a controllable entity in the scene, either the player or someone else. 

The only difference between the player character and an identically-configured actor is whether 'isPlayer' is set 
to true or false. 

Ideally this class should also be used for enemies, even if they shouldn't be controlled (add a 'controllable' 
bool to class to handle this)

	/// Actor health

	/// <summary>
